# PS-Custom-Profiles
Custom Slicer profiles for PrusaSlicer

My settings are bad, but an improvement over the defaults.

"Optimzed" (bold claim, I know) for extremely fine detail prints.  

I'm mainly maintaining this just so I can keep my own profiles in version control. 

These profiles are terrible, and do suck, do not use them. unless your an idiot like me and want to print at 0.539881 c^3/sec.

Current as of PrusaSlicer `Version 2.6.1+linux-x64-GTK3`

Please see [Prusa's Github](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer) for offical release of the slicer itself.
