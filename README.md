Custom Slicer profiles for PrusaSlicer

My settings are bad, but an improvement over the defaults

"Optimzed" (bold claim, I know) for extremely fine detail prints.  

I'm mainly maintaining this just so I can keep my own profiles in version control. 

These profiles are terrible, and do suck, do not use, uless your an idiot like me and want to print at 0.539881 c^3/sec

Current as of PrusaSlicer `Version 2.6.1+linux-x64-GTK3`
